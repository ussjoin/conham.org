* What can you do with a ham radio license?
  * Disaster Communication
    * ARES
      * Public Service
      * Good excuse to play with weird forms of operation
    * Internet-free communications
      * No encryption, but digital modes all over
      * Insane propagation: moonbounce, greyline, tropospheric ducting
* Good first things to do when you get your license
  * Get a radio
    * Nearly any one will do at the beginning
    * If you're tech, no point in getting an HF rig, because you can't use it
    * Get an HT, because you might actually bring it with you (e.g., to cons)
    * One really cheap good one: Baofeng (also moddable, link to pages)
    * You don't need all the accessories. A rubber duck antenna is just fine to start.
      * OK, maybe just one: for con use, an acoustic tube headset is nice for comfort / not annoying others
  * Connect to your local ham community
    * Mostly older, but at least get on a repeater
    * How to find repeaters in your area
      * Note: some repeaters will be inactive. Think of them like forums that no one uses.
  * Connect to your local ARES team
    * Not least because these tend to be younger, more tech-savvy people
* Neat projects made possible with a ham license
  * Kristin (nee Chris) Paget - RFID long-range
  * Michael Ossmann - Fucking everything (but link to HackRF preso somewhere)
  * Ultra-range WiFi (find a project of this)
